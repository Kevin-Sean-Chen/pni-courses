  title    = "Cerebral vasodilation during hypercapnia. Role of
              glibenclamide-sensitive potassium channels and nitric oxide",
  author   = "Faraci, F M and Breese, K R and Heistad, D D",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of these experiments was to
              examine mechanisms by which hypercapnia produces vasodilatation
              in brain. We examined the hypothesis that dilatation of cerebral
              arterioles during hypercapnia is dependent on activation of
              ATP-sensitive potassium channels and formation of nitric oxide.
              METHODS: Diameters of cerebral arterioles were measured using a
              closed cranial window in anesthetized rabbits. Changes in
              diameter of arterioles were measured in response to topical
              application of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside and during
              two levels of systemic hypercapnia. RESULTS: Increasing arterial
              PCO2 from 32 +/- 1 mm Hg (mean +/- SE) to 54 +/- 1 and 66 +/- 1
              mm Hg dilated cerebral arterioles by 25 +/- 3\% and 38 +/- 5\%,
              respectively, from a control diameter of 93 +/- 3 microns. The
              response to the low level of hypercapnia was attenuated (25 +/-
              3\% versus 16 +/- 4\%, P < .05) by glibenclamide (1 mumol/L), an
              inhibitor of ATP-sensitive potassium channels. Vasodilatation in
              response to the high level of hypercapnia was not affected by
              glibenclamide. Increases in arteriolar diameter in response to
              sodium nitroprusside were not inhibited by glibenclamide.
              NG-nitro-L-arginine (300 mumol/L), an inhibitor of nitric oxide
              synthase, completely inhibited dilatation of cerebral arterioles
              in response to the low level of hypercapnia and inhibited
              vasodilatation during the high level of hypercapnia by 66\%.
              CONCLUSIONS: Thus, activation of glibenclamide-sensitive
              potassium channels may contribute to dilatation of cerebral
              arterioles during hypercapnia. Cerebral vasodilatation during
              hypercapnia is dependent in large part on production of nitric
              oxide.",

              Bandettini, Peter A",
  abstract = "Variations in the subject's heart rate and breathing pattern have
              been shown to result in significant fMRI signal changes, mediated
              in part by non-neuronal physiological mechanisms such as global
              changes in levels of arterial CO(2). When these physiological
              changes are correlated with a task, as may happen in response to
              emotional stimuli or tasks that change levels of arousal, a
              concern arises that non-neuronal physiologically-induced signal
              changes may be misinterpreted as reflecting task-related neuronal
              activation. The purpose of this study is to provide information
              that can help in determining whether task activation maps are
              influenced by task-correlated physiological noise, particularly
              task-correlated breathing changes. We also compare different
              strategies to reduce the influence of physiological noise. Two
              paradigms are investigated--1) a lexical decision task where some
              subjects showed task-related breathing changes, and 2) a task
              where subjects were instructed to hold their breath during the
              presentation of contrast-reversing checkerboard, an extreme case
              of task-correlated physiological noise. Consistent with previous
              literature, we find that MRI signal changes correlated with
              variations in breathing depth and rate have a characteristic
              spatial and temporal profile that is different from the typical
              activation-induced BOLD response. The delineation of activation
              in the presence of task correlated breathing changes was improved
              either by independent component analysis, or by including
              specific nuisance regressors in a regression analysis. The
              difference in the spatial and temporal characteristics of
              physiological-induced and neuronal-induced fluctuations exploited
              by these strategies suggests that activation can be studied even
              in the presence of task-correlated physiological changes.",

              a uniform global stimulus such as hypercapnia to quantitatively
              investigate the regional BOLD response in the human brain. In 10

              of this study was to investigate the impact of these
              low-frequency respiration variations on both task activation fMRI
              studies and resting-state functional connectivity analysis.
              Unlike MR signal changes correlated with the breathing motion (
              approximately 0.3 Hz), BOLD signal changes correlated with
              across-breath variations in respiratory volume ( approximately
              0.03 Hz) appear localized to blood vessels and regions with high
              blood volume, such as gray matter, similar to changes seen in
              response to a breath-hold challenge. In addition, the
              respiration-variation-induced signal changes were found to
              coincide with many of the areas identified as part of the
              'default mode' network, a set of brain regions hypothesized to be
              more active at rest. Regions could therefore be classified as
              being part of a resting network based on their similar
              respiration-induced changes rather than their synchronized

              studying brain organization. A critical element of these analyses
              is to distinguish variance due to neurobiological signals from
              variance due to nonneurobiological signals. Multiecho fMRI
              techniques are a promising means for making such distinctions
              based on signal decay properties. Here, we report that multiecho
              fMRI techniques enable excellent removal of certain kinds of
              artifactual variance, namely, spatially focal artifacts due to
              motion. By removing these artifacts, multiecho techniques reveal
              frequent, large-amplitude blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)
              signal changes present across all gray matter that are also
              linked to motion. These whole-brain BOLD signals could reflect
              widespread neural processes or other processes, such as
              alterations in blood partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2)
              due to ventilation changes. By acquiring multiecho data while
              monitoring breathing, we demonstrate that whole-brain BOLD
              signals in the resting state are often caused by changes in
              breathing that co-occur with head motion. These widespread
              respiratory fMRI signals cannot be isolated from neurobiological
              signals by multiecho techniques because they occur via the same
              BOLD mechanism. Respiratory signals must therefore be removed by
              some other technique to isolate neurobiological covariance in
              fMRI time series. Several methods for removing global artifacts
              are demonstrated and compared, and were found to yield fMRI time
              series essentially free of motion-related influences. These
              results identify two kinds of motion-associated fMRI variance,
              with different physical mechanisms and spatial profiles, each of
              which strongly and differentially influences functional
              connectivity patterns. Distance-dependent patterns in covariance
              are nearly entirely attributable to non-BOLD artifacts.",

              both blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) and perfusion-based
              functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is presented.
              In the proposed method, significant principal components are
              derived from noise regions-of-interest (ROI) in which the time
              series data are unlikely to be modulated by neural activity.
              These components are then included as nuisance parameters within
              general linear models for BOLD and perfusion-based fMRI time
              series data. Two approaches for the determination of the noise
              ROI are considered. The first method uses high-resolution
              anatomical data to define a region of interest composed primarily
              of white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, while the second method
              defines a region based upon the temporal standard deviation of
              the time series data. With the application of CompCor, the
              temporal standard deviation of resting-state perfusion and BOLD
              data in gray matter regions was significantly reduced as compared
              to either no correction or the application of a previously
              described retrospective image based correction scheme
              (RETROICOR). For both functional perfusion and BOLD data, the
              application of CompCor significantly increased the number of
              activated voxels as compared to no correction. In addition, for
              functional BOLD data, there were significantly more activated
              voxels detected with CompCor as compared to RETROICOR. In
              comparison to RETROICOR, CompCor has the advantage of not
              requiring external monitoring of physiological fluctuations.",

              components of structural and functional brain image analysis.
              Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function
              to determine the best registration. To date, little attention has
              been focused on the optimization method itself, even though the
              success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of
              this optimization. This paper examines the optimization process
              in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used multiresolution
              local optimization methods can, and do, get trapped in local
              minima. To address this problem, two approaches are taken: (1) to
              apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a novel hybrid
              global-local optimization method. This new optimization method is
              specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It
              substantially reduces the likelihood of producing
              misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima. The
              increased robustness of the method, compared to other commonly
              used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In addition,
              the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a series of
              experiments with motion correction. These motion correction
              experiments also investigate how the results are affected by

              Motion-related signal changes are not removed by a variety of
              motion-based regressors, but are effectively reduced by global
              signal regression. We link several measures of data quality to

              variability is influenced by chemoreflex regulation. In search
              for periodicities in the variability due to instability of the
              respiratory control system, spectral analysis was applied to
              breath-to-breath variables in 19 healthy subjects at rest. During
              room-air breathing, coherent oscillations in end-tidal CO2
              (PET(CO2)) and mean inspiratory flow (VI/TI) were found in 15
              subjects with frequencies mostly below 0.15 cycles per breath.
              Coherent oscillations in PET(CO2) and VI/TI were expressed by
              gain (0.13 to 0.34 L/second small middle dot kPa) and phase (-170
              degrees to +8 degrees ). The oscillations in VI/TI were in phase
              with inspiratory volume (VI). A model that describes the effects
              of chemoreflex feedback to noise in the system could explain
              these gains and phases, whereas a model without chemoreflex could
              not. During 100\% O2 breathing, only eight subjects had coherent
              oscillations in PET(CO2) and VI/TI. The coherent oscillations in
              PET(CO2) and VI/TI were interpreted as a manifestation of
              chemoreflex activity. We conclude that respiratory variability is
              not a random process but contains information on chemoreflex
              properties, such as the chemoreflex gain. The analysis of

              solutions can generalize to unseen data acquired at new sites.
              Here, we introduce the MRI Quality Control tool (MRIQC), a tool
              for extracting quality measures and fitting a binary
              (accept/exclude) classifier. Our tool can be run both locally and
              as a free online service via the OpenNeuro.org portal. The
              classifier is trained on a publicly available, multi-site dataset
              (17 sites, N = 1102). We perform model selection evaluating
              different normalization and feature exclusion approaches aimed at
              maximizing across-site generalization and estimate an accuracy of
              76\%$\pm$13\% on new sites, using leave-one-site-out
              cross-validation. We confirm that result on a held-out dataset (2

              performance of the trained classifier is statistically above
              chance, we show that it is susceptible to site effects and unable
              to account for artifacts specific to new sites. MRIQC performs
              with high accuracy in intra-site prediction, but performance on
              unseen sites leaves space for improvement which might require
              more labeled data and new approaches to the between-site
              variability. Overcoming these limitations is crucial for a more

              in different cognitive tasks. The extent of PMR-deactivations is
              correlated with task-demands and associated with successful
              performance in various cognitive domains. In the domain of
              episodic memory, functional MRI (fMRI) studies found that
              PMR-deactivations reliably predict learning (successful
              encoding). Yet it is unclear what explains this relation. One
              intriguing possibility is that PMR-deactivations are partially
              mediated by respiratory artifacts. There is evidence that the
              fMRI signal in PMR is particularly prone to respiratory
              artifacts, because of its large surrounding blood vessels. As
              respiratory fluctuations have been shown to track changes in
              attention, it is critical for the general interpretation of fMRI
              results to clarify the relation between respiratory fluctuations,
              cognitive performance, and fMRI signal. Here, we investigated
              this issue by measuring respiration during word encoding,
              together with a breath-holding condition during fMRI-scanning.
              Stimulus-locked respiratory analyses showed that respiratory
              fluctuations predicted successful encoding via a respiratory
              phase-locking mechanism. At the same time, the fMRI analyses
              showed that PMR-deactivations associated with learning were
              reduced during breath-holding and correlated with individual
              differences in the respiratory phase-locking effect during normal
              breathing. A left frontal region--used as a control region--did
              not show these effects. These findings indicate that respiration
              is a critical factor in explaining the link between
              PMR-deactivation and successful cognitive performance. Further
              research is necessary to demonstrate whether our findings are

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In the past, functional MR imaging
              techniques have been used successfully to determine
              cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to various stimuli,
              complementing the arsenal of functional brain investigations
              feasible with MR imaging. While previous studies have focused on
              blood oxygenation changes under vasodilatory stress, the aim of
              this study was to assess regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF)
              changes during breath-holding by using a flow-sensitive
              alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) imaging technique. METHODS:
              In six healthy volunteers, FAIR images were acquired during
              alternating periods of breath-holding and breathing at 40-second
              intervals after inspiration and at 30-second intervals after
              expiration, for a total dynamic scanning time of 10 minutes. To
              quantify the rCBF changes, we obtained 2.5-minute baseline
              samples during normal breathing. RESULTS: Repeated challenges of
              breath-holding induced an overall rise in rCBF. In general, rCBF
              changes were greatest in gray matter and were insignificant in
              white matter. Using the mean values of the baseline images
              collected before breath-holding to calculate the rCBF changes, we
              found that quantitative analysis yielded an rCBF increase of 47\%
              to 87\% after breath-holding. The rCBF changes clearly depended
              on the breath-holding duration and technique; however, for one
              given breath-holding paradigm the results showed relatively small
              interindividual variability. CONCLUSION: rCBF changes during a
              simple vascular challenge can be detected and quantified by means
              of functional MR imaging at 1.5 T. Noninvasive assessment of CVR
              could become a useful clinical tool to identify persons with
              impaired CVR.",

              signal fluctuations both in the visual cortex and in the whole
              brain gray matter. The following sources of variance were
              evaluated separately: low-frequency drifts due to scanner
              instability, effects correlated with respiratory and cardiac
              cycles, effects due to variability in the respiratory flow rate
              and cardiac rate, and other sources, tentatively attributed to
              spontaneous neuronal activity. We found that low-frequency drifts
              are the most significant source of fMRI signal fluctuations
              (3.0\% signal change in the visual cortex, TE=32 ms), followed by
              spontaneous neuronal activity (2.9\%), thermal noise (2.1\%),
              effects due to variability in physiological rates (respiration
              0.9\%, heartbeat 0.9\%), and correlated with physiological cycles

              the variance related to fluctuations in the rates of respiration
              volume change and cardiac pulsation. Our results also indicate
              that, compared to the whole brain gray matter, the visual cortex
              has higher sensitivity to changes in both the rate of respiration
              and the spontaneous resting-state activity. Under the conditions
              of this study, spontaneous neuronal activity is one of the major
              contributors to the measured fMRI signal fluctuations, increasing

              head movement during scanning can disproportionately bias
              connectivity estimates, despite various preprocessing efforts.
              Further complications for interregional connectivity estimation
              from time domain signals include the unaccounted reduction in
              BOLD degrees of freedom related to sensitivity losses from high
              subject motion. To address these issues, we describe an
              integrated strategy for data acquisition, denoising, and
              connectivity estimation. This strategy builds on our previously
              published technique combining data acquisition with multiecho
              (ME) echo planar imaging and analysis with spatial independent
              component analysis (ICA), called ME-ICA, which distinguishes BOLD
              (neuronal) and non-BOLD (artifactual) components based on linear
              echo-time dependence of signals-a characteristic property of BOLD
              T*2 signal changes. Here we show for 32 control subjects that
              this method provides a physically principled and nearly
              operator-independent way of removing complex artifacts such as
              motion from resting state data. We then describe a robust

              estimator, called independent components regression, considerably
              simplifies statistical inference for functional connectivity
              because degrees of freedom equals the number of independent
              coefficients. Compared with traditional connectivity estimation
              methods, the proposed strategy results in fourfold improvements

              (MRI) signal at 3 T arising from spontaneous fluctuations in
              arterial carbon dioxide level in volunteers at rest. Fluctuations
              in the partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (Pet(CO(2)))
              of +/-1.1 mm Hg in the frequency range 0-0.05 Hz were observed in
              a cohort of nine volunteers. Correlating with these fluctuations
              were significant generalized grey and white matter BOLD signal
              fluctuations. We observed a mean (+/-standard error) regression
              coefficient across the group of 0.110 +/- 0.033\% BOLD signal
              change per mm Hg CO(2) for grey matter and 0.049 +/- 0.022\% per
              mm Hg in white matter. Pet(CO(2))-related BOLD signal
              fluctuations showed regional differences across the grey matter,
              suggesting variability of the responsiveness to carbon dioxide at
              rest. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results were
              corroborated by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound
              measurements of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood velocity
              in a cohort of four volunteers. Significant Pet(CO(2))-correlated
              fluctuations in MCA blood velocity were observed with a lag of
              6.3 +/- 1.2 s (mean +/- standard error) with respect to
              Pet(CO(2)) changes. This haemodynamic lag was adopted in the
              analysis of the BOLD signal. Doppler ultrasound suggests that a
              component of low-frequency BOLD signal fluctuations is mediated
              by CO(2)-induced changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF). These
              fluctuations are a source of physiological noise and a
              potentially important confounding factor in fMRI paradigms that
              modify breathing. However, they can also be used for mapping
              regional vascular responsiveness to CO(2).",

  author   = "Zhang, Y and Brady, M and Smith, S",
  abstract = "The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for
              statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images
              because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise
              constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a
              histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no
              spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM
              model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of
              noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to
              artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field
              distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods
              produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel
              hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic
              process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be
              observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through
              observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model
              is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the
              HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information
              is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites.
              Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation
              by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using
              MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the
              HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show that by
              incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a
              HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be
              achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be
              combined with other techniques. As an example, we show how the
              bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997)
              can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a
              three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image

              exploited to investigate the connectivity of functional networks
              in human brain with high spatial-resolution. Although mounting
              evidence points towards a neuronal contribution to this activity,
              its functional role and dependence on behavioral state remain
              unclear. In this work, we used BOLD fMRI at 7 T to study the
              modulation of spontaneous activity in occipital areas by various
              behavioral conditions, including resting with eyes closed, eyes
              open with visual fixation, and eyes open with fixation and focal
              visual stimulation. Spontaneous activity was separated from
              evoked activity and from signal fluctuations related to cardiac
              and respiratory cycles. We found that spontaneous activity in
              visual areas was substantially reduced (amplitude (44\%) and
              coherence (25\%)) with the fixation conditions relative to the
              eyes-closed condition. No significant further modulation was
              observed when the visual stimulus was added. The observed
              dependence on behavioral condition suggests that part of
              spontaneous fMRI signal fluctuations represents neuronal
              activity. Possible mechanisms for the modulation of spontaneous
              activity by behavioral state are discussed. The observed linear

              for fMRI studies, which ideally should take into account the

              the investigation of brain function in healthy individuals,

              arises from a complex mixture of neuronal, metabolic and vascular
              processes, being therefore an indirect measure of neuronal
              activity, which is further severely corrupted by multiple
              non-neuronal fluctuations of instrumental, physiological or
              subject-specific origin. This review aims to provide a
              comprehensive summary of existing methods for cleaning the BOLD
              fMRI signal. The description is given from a methodological point
              of view, focusing on the operation of the different techniques in
              addition to pointing out the advantages and limitations in their
              application. Since motion-related and physiological noise
              fluctuations are two of the main noise components of the signal,
              techniques targeting their removal are primarily addressed,
              including both data-driven approaches and using external
              recordings. Data-driven approaches, which are less specific in
              the assumed model and can simultaneously reduce multiple noise
              fluctuations, are mainly based on data decomposition techniques
              such as principal and independent component analysis.
              Importantly, the usefulness of strategies that benefit from the
              information available in the phase component of the signal, or in

  abstract = "The central autonomic network (CAN) has been described in animal
              models but has been difficult to elucidate in humans. Potential
              confounds include physiological noise artifacts affecting
              brainstem neuroimaging data, and difficulty in deriving
              non-invasive continuous assessments of autonomic modulation. We
              have developed and implemented a new method which relates
              cardiac-gated fMRI timeseries with continuous-time heart rate
              variability (HRV) to estimate central autonomic processing. As
              many autonomic structures of interest are in brain regions
              strongly affected by cardiogenic pulsatility, we chose to
              cardiac-gate our fMRI acquisition to increase sensitivity.
              Cardiac-gating introduces T1-variability, which was corrected by
              transforming fMRI data to a fixed TR using a previously published
              method [Guimaraes, A.R., Melcher, J.R., et al., 1998. Imaging
              subcortical auditory activity in humans. Hum. Brain Mapp. 6(1),
              33-41]. The electrocardiogram was analyzed with a novel point
              process adaptive-filter algorithm for computation of the
              high-frequency (HF) index, reflecting the time-varying dynamics
              of efferent cardiovagal modulation. Central command of
              cardiovagal outflow was inferred by using the resample HF
              timeseries as a regressor to the fMRI data. A grip task was used
              to perturb the autonomic nervous system. Our combined HRV-fMRI
              approach demonstrated HF correlation with fMRI activity in the

              periaqueductal gray, amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and
              dorsomedial/dorsolateral prefrontal, posterior insular, and
              middle temporal cortices. While some regions consistent with
              central cardiovagal control in animal models gave corroborative
              evidence for our methodology, other mostly higher cortical or
              limbic-related brain regions may be unique to humans. Our
              approach should be optimized and applied to study the human brain

              there are problems with accounting for temporal autocorrelations

              utilized temporal filtering strategies to either shape these
              autocorrelations or remove them. Shaping, or ``coloring,''
              attempts to negate the effects of not accurately knowing the
              intrinsic autocorrelations by imposing known autocorrelation via
              temporal filtering. Removing the autocorrelation, or
              ``prewhitening,'' gives the best linear unbiased estimator,
              assuming that the autocorrelation is accurately known. For
              single-event designs, the efficiency of the estimator is
              considerably higher for prewhitening compared with coloring.
              However, it has been suggested that sufficiently accurate
              estimates of the autocorrelation are currently not available to
              give prewhitening acceptable bias. To overcome this, we consider
              different ways to estimate the autocorrelation for use in
              prewhitening. After high-pass filtering is performed, a Tukey
              taper (set to smooth the spectral density more than would
              normally be used in spectral density estimation) performs best.
              Importantly, estimation is further improved by using nonlinear
              spatial filtering to smooth the estimated autocorrelation, but
              only within tissue type. Using this approach when prewhitening
              reduced bias to close to zero at probability levels as low as 1 x
