	Abstract = {In functional magnetic resonance imaging statistical analysis
              there are problems with accounting for temporal autocorrelations
              when assessing change within voxels. Techniques to date have
              utilized temporal filtering strategies to either shape these
              autocorrelations or remove them. Shaping, or ``coloring,''
              attempts to negate the effects of not accurately knowing the
              intrinsic autocorrelations by imposing known autocorrelation via
              temporal filtering. Removing the autocorrelation, or
              ``prewhitening,'' gives the best linear unbiased estimator,
              assuming that the autocorrelation is accurately known. For
              single-event designs, the efficiency of the estimator is
              considerably higher for prewhitening compared with coloring.
              However, it has been suggested that sufficiently accurate
              estimates of the autocorrelation are currently not available to
              give prewhitening acceptable bias. To overcome this, we consider
              different ways to estimate the autocorrelation for use in
              prewhitening. After high-pass filtering is performed, a Tukey
              taper (set to smooth the spectral density more than would
              normally be used in spectral density estimation) performs best.
              Importantly, estimation is further improved by using nonlinear
              spatial filtering to smooth the estimated autocorrelation, but
              only within tissue type. Using this approach when prewhitening
              reduced bias to close to zero at probability levels as low as 1 x
              10(-5).},

	Abstract = {When modelling FMRI and other MRI time-series data, a Bayesian
              approach based on adaptive spatial smoothness priors is a
              compelling alternative to using a standard generalized linear
              model (GLM) on presmoothed data. Another benefit of the Bayesian
              approach is that biophysical prior information can be
              incorporated in a principled manner; however, this requirement
              for a fixed non-spatial prior on a parameter would normally
              preclude using spatial regularization on that same parameter. We
              have developed a Gaussian-process-based prior to apply adaptive
              spatial regularization while still ensuring that the fixed
              biophysical prior is correctly applied on each voxel. A
              parameterized covariance matrix provides separate control over
              the variance (the diagonal elements) and the between-voxel
              correlation (due to off-diagonal elements). Analysis proceeds
              using evidence optimization (EO), with variational Bayes (VB)
              updates used for some parameters. The method can also be applied
              to non-linear forward models by using a linear Taylor expansion
              centred on the latest parameter estimates. Applying the method to
              FMRI with a constrained haemodynamic response function (HRF)
              shape model shows improved fits in simulations, compared to using
              either the non-spatial or spatial-smoothness prior alone. We also
              analyse multi-inversion arterial spin labelling data using a
              non-linear perfusion model to estimate cerebral blood flow and
              bolus arrival time. By combining both types of prior information,
              this new prior performs consistently well across a wider range of
              situations than either prior alone, and provides better estimates
              when both types of prior information are relevant.},

              Diffusion-based spatial priors for imaging. NeuroImage 38,
              677-695]. The current paper continues this theme, applying it to
              a single-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
              study of the auditory system. We show that spatial priors on
              functional activations, based on diffusion, can be formulated in
              terms of the eigenmodes of a graph Laplacian. This allows one to
              discard eigenmodes with small eigenvalues, to provide a
              computationally efficient scheme. Furthermore, this formulation
              shows that diffusion-based priors are a generalization of
              conventional Laplacian priors [Penny, W.D., Trujillo-Barreto,
              N.J., Friston, K.J., 2005. Bayesian fMRI time series analysis
              with spatial priors. NeuroImage 24, 350-362]. Finally, we show
              how diffusion-based priors are a special case of Gaussian process
              models that can be inverted using classical covariance component
              estimation techniques like restricted maximum likelihood
              [Patterson, H.D., Thompson, R., 1974. Maximum likelihood
              estimation of components of variance. Paper presented at: 8th
              International Biometrics Conference (Constanta, Romania)]. The
              convention in SPM is to smooth data with a fixed isotropic
              Gaussian kernel before inverting a mass-univariate statistical
              model. This entails the strong assumption that data are generated
              smoothly throughout the brain. However, there is no way to
              determine if this assumption is supported by the data, because
              data are smoothed before statistical modeling. In contrast, if a
              spatial prior is used, smoothness is estimated given non-smoothed
              data. Explicit spatial priors enable formal model comparison of
              different prior assumptions, e.g., that data are generated from a
              stationary (i.e., fixed throughout the brain) or non-stationary
              spatial process. Indeed, for the auditory data we provide strong
              evidence for a non-stationary process, which concurs with a
              qualitative comparison of predicted activations at the boundary
              of functionally selective regions.},

              statistical problem is to find regions where the process studied

              probability for exceeding the level in the entire set is equal to
              some predefined value is a difficult problem connected to the

                   recently, a range of probabilistic latent variable models
                   applied to fMRI data have been successful in a variety of
                   tasks, including identifying similarity patterns in neural
                   data (Representational Similarity Analysis and its empirical
                   Bayes variant, RSA and BRSA; Intersubject Functional

                   (Shared Response Mapping; SRM), and mapping between brain
                   and behavior (Joint Modeling). Although these methods share
                   some underpinnings, they have been developed as distinct
                   methods, with distinct algorithms and software tools. We
                   show how the matrix-variate normal (MN) formalism can unify
                   some of these methods into a single framework. In doing so,
                   we gain the ability to reuse noise modeling assumptions,
                   algorithms, and code across models. Our primary theoretical
                   contribution shows how some of these methods can be written
                   as instantiations of the same model, allowing us to
                   generalize them to flexibly modeling structured noise
                   covariances. Our formalism permits novel model variants and
                   improved estimation strategies: in contrast to SRM, the
                   number of parameters for MN-SRM does not scale with the
                   number of voxels or subjects; in contrast to BRSA, the
                   number of parameters for MN-RSA scales additively rather
                   than multiplicatively in the number of voxels. We
                   empirically demonstrate advantages of two new methods
                   derived in the formalism: for MN-RSA, we show up to 10x
                   improvement in runtime, up to 6x improvement in RMSE, and
                   more conservative behavior under the null. For MN-SRM, our
                   method grants a modest improvement to out-of-sample
                   reconstruction while relaxing the orthonormality constraint
                   of SRM. We also provide a software prototyping tool for MN

	Abstract = {Spatial whole-brain Bayesian modeling of task-related functional
              magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a great computational
              challenge. Most of the currently proposed methods therefore do
              inference in subregions of the brain separately or do approximate
              inference without comparison to the true posterior distribution.
              A popular such method, which is now the standard method for
              Bayesian single subject analysis in the SPM software, is
              introduced in Penny et al. (2005b). The method processes the data
              slice-by-slice and uses an approximate variational Bayes (VB)
              estimation algorithm that enforces posterior independence between
              activity coefficients in different voxels. We introduce a fast
              and practical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme for exact
              inference in the same model, both slice-wise and for the whole
              brain using a 3D prior on activity coefficients. The algorithm
              exploits sparsity and uses modern techniques for efficient
              sampling from high-dimensional Gaussian distributions, leading to
              speed-ups without which MCMC would not be a practical option.
              Using MCMC, we are for the first time able to evaluate the
              approximate VB posterior against the exact MCMC posterior, and
              show that VB can lead to spurious activation. In addition, we
              develop an improved VB method that drops the assumption of
              independent voxels a posteriori. This algorithm is shown to be
              much faster than both MCMC and the original VB for large
              datasets, with negligible error compared to the MCMC posterior.},

                   model (GLM) (Worsley and Friston 1995). Here, we propose a
                   Bayesian GLM for cs-fMRI, which employs a class of
                   sophisticated spatial processes to flexibly model latent
                   activation fields. We use integrated nested Laplacian
                   approximation (INLA), a highly accurate and efficient
                   Bayesian computation technique (Rue et al. 2009). To
                   identify regions of activation, we propose an excursions set
                   method based on the joint posterior distribution of the
                   latent fields, which eliminates the need for multiple
                   comparisons correction. Finally, we address a gap in the
                   existing literature by proposing a novel Bayesian approach
                   for multi-subject analysis. The methods are validated and
                   compared to the classical GLM through simulation studies and
                   a motor task fMRI study from the Human Connectome Project.
                   The proposed Bayesian approach results in smoother
                   activation estimates, more accurate false positive control,
                   and increased power to detect truly active regions.},
